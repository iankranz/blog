You can go ahead and disregard this post. There's not much here.

If you insist on continuing to read, I'll quickly explain why I'm really loving ChatGPT these days.

So ChatGPT is just a brand basically. It's a proprietary LLM (Large Language Model) from OpenAI, a company who we are pretty sure is cool but TBD on that. It’s like how we all call tissues Kleenex even though Kleenex is the brand and not what the thing actually is. Yeah, same thing with ChatGPT. You can use other AIs that do basically the same thing but don’t have the well-known ChatGPT brand.

Anyways, I’ve been using ChatGPT quite a bit because I’m not that great at skimming Google search results quickly. So when I have a question and I Google it, it takes forever for me to go through the links and look for the answers to my actual questions. Even then, I need to deal with a bunch of ads and other annoyances, like people asking to me to sign up for their newsletters.

(By the way I do have a newsletter, but I’m not going to link it here, cus I’m a nice guy)

But when I ask ChatGPT questions, the interface is much more simple and I know that if I craft my prompt well enough I can get the answers I’m looking for in one shot. Granted, I know ChatGPT can give false information, so I always fact check it before using the info. That, and it’s just a more simple interface for getting information.

I also enjoy the conversational feel of the whole thing. Have you ever had someone shame you for asking them a question that they say is easily google-able. I think there’s more to it than just being an idiot who doesn’t know they can google stuff. Moreso, I think that some people enjoy learning about stuff in a conversational format, especially those of us who are not fast readers. Something about the interaction makes the information stick, and it’s nice to be able to add follow-ups easily. I think ChatGPT provides a similar environment, which is pretty cool.

Mostly, I use it for random problems I have, a lot of which are coding-related. When I’m reading documentation, it’s like I have the documentation there as well as someone who has already read the documentation and who doesn’t mind answering my questions. It’s pretty solid, and I think it has contributed to my productivity. Also, I get to ask random stuff like what should you pack for a barbeque, and honestly it has helped me remember some stuff I would have forgotten.

There you have it. There’s the content. I didn’t think I was going to write anything, but I did. Thanks for reading. See you!
